## Blog 11:

Donald Knuth talked about literate programming as the idea to write a program so that people can read it not just computers. This is implemented today in many different types of ways to use programming in line with written documents. Rmarkdown is a variant of this that allows the combination of words and code to make a document. This is good for reproducible research as then reviewers will be able run code and obtain the same results in the document. It seems like maybe while he at one point was at the front of literate programming maybe now since he doesn't use some of the newer programs he is falling behind and so the current reality has surpassed his vision. (Not sure if that is true, just a thought, it was hard to listen to him)
