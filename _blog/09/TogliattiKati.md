There are many purposes of the grammar of graphics. The first is to develop statistical graphic systems, second is to understand the steps taken to generate charts and graphs. The third is to develop, ultimately intelligent systems and finally they hope to define problem specification and user interaction in a way that enables graphic systems to be understood by ordinary people.
